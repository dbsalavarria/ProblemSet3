# ProblemSet3

This programs were written and submitted by Diego Baños Salavarría
They were finished on October 3rd 2019 for Audio Programming in C with Akito van Troyer
Due date: October 4rd at 12:00 a.m.
Files included: 3.1.c, 3.2.c and 3.3.c
I think 3.1 is still incomplete because I was not able to handle cases were notes include accidentals.
3.2 was largely based on the example from the Audio Programming book. 2pi radians is a complete cycle of a sine wave but I did not understand the instructions regarding the phase.
3.3 was the most fun to make. Also really challenging.
